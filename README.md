# Object Tracking Application
This is LOGIC DESIGN PROJECT (CO3091) Assignment (Semester: 232, Duration: 06 weeks)
## Overview
The **Object Tracking Application** is designed to provide an efficient solution for real-time object detection and tracking, leveraging the **RISC-V** architecture and the **VexRiscv CPU core**. This system integrates cutting-edge algorithms, including **YOLOv4-tiny** for object detection and **Kalman Filter** for predictive tracking, ensuring high-performance operation even on resource-constrained devices.

This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of the RISC-V instruction set architecture in executing AI-powered tasks, with a focus on object tracking in dynamic environments. The system is capable of identifying and tracking objects across frames, making it highly suitable for use cases in **surveillance**, **robotics**, **autonomous navigation**, and **smart environments**.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes the lightweight **YOLOv4-tiny** model for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Predictive Tracking**: Implements **Kalman Filter** for continuous tracking and prediction of object locations.
- **Efficient Optimization**: Integrates the **Hungarian Algorithm** for optimal task assignment in tracking applications.
- **RISC-V Optimization**: Runs efficiently on RISC-V architecture using the VexRiscv CPU core.
