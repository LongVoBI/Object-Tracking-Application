# Object-Tracking-Application
LOGIC DESIGN PROJECT (CO3091)  Assignment (Semester: 232, Duration: 06 weeks)

#### **Introduction**
The Object Tracking Application is designed to provide an efficient solution for real-time object detection and tracking using a RISC-V-based architecture. By integrating advanced algorithms such as YOLOv4-tiny for object detection and the Kalman Filter for tracking, this system is optimized for performance while running on the VexRiscv CPU core. This project leverages the flexibility and power of the RISC-V instruction set architecture to perform tasks traditionally handled by more resource-heavy processors.

The system tracks moving objects in dynamic environments, providing critical insights for fields like surveillance, robotics, and autonomous navigation. By combining object detection, predictive tracking, and optimization algorithms such as the Hungarian Algorithm, the application ensures precise and efficient tracking in real time, even in complex and cluttered environments.

This project highlights the potential of RISC-V in enabling AI-powered applications with reduced resource consumption, making it an ideal choice for systems with limited computational resources.
